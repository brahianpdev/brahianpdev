### About Me
Beyond the terminal, I value peace of mind and continuous personal growth. I am a lifelong self-learner at heart; currently, I spend much of my free time experimenting with my Homelab, where I explore networking, automation, and virtualization using Proxmox.

I truly enjoy being outdoors, especially near the ocean. I am a big animal lover (dogs, monkeys, and giraffes are my favorites), and I appreciate the simple things: a good cup of coffee, an engaging book, and a quiet environment. I firmly believe that discipline and curiosity are the best tools for growth, both as an engineer and as a person.

**Languages:** Spanish (Native), Portuguese (Advanced), English (Conversational - constantly improving).
