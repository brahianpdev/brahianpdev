# 👋 Hi, I'm Brahian Pereyra

### Backend Developer | Java & Spring Boot | Cloud & Security Enthusiast

I'm a **backend developer** focused on **Java and Spring Boot**, with experience building **secure, maintainable microservices** in fintech environments.  
At **Mercado Libre**, I contributed to **identity verification (KYC)** flows, **integrated ML models**, and worked on improving **platform stability and developer experience**.

As part of the **Security Guardian** initiative, I supported secure development by reviewing code, validating dependencies, and participating in **threat modeling sessions**.  
I also mentored new developers during onboarding and shared **AI tools** to simplify daily workflows.

Outside of work, I’m developing **[MainHost](https://mainhost.dyallab.com.ar/)** — a personal project that automates **Minecraft and TeamSpeak server hosting**, with a focus on **performance, uptime, and accessibility**.
